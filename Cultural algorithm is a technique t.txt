Cultural algorithm is a technique that incorporates domain knowledge obtained during the evolutionary process as to make the search process more efficient. It have been successfully applied to several types of optimization problems. However, until now, nobody had proposed a cultural algorithm for solving Kenken Puzzle. It were developed by Robert G. Reynolds as a complement to the metaphor adopted by evolutionary algorithms, which was mainly focused on genetic concepts and on the natural selection mechanism.

The Cultural Algorithm (CA) is a meta-heuristic designed to handle complex problems such as the KenKen puzzle, by combining two types of learning. On one side, it uses a regular evolutionary search with random variation, and on the other, it builds a structured form of knowledge from its best solutions. Since KenKen is a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), the algorithm must satisfy both the Latin Square rules (each number must appear once per row and column) and the arithmetic cage rules (using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

Cultural algorithms operate on two spaces. First, they operate on the population space like any other evolution a computational method that involves a group of entities (called population) is utilized. Every individual possesses a group of characteristics that do not depend on one another, enabling us to assess its fitness. Over time, such individuals can be substituted by certain of its offspring, derived from after applying a collection of operators to the population. The second domain is the belief space, where the understanding advantage gained by the individuals through the process of evolution the procedure is saved. The details included in this area must be available to any individual, enabling them to utilize it for alter its actions.
