This project provides a kenken puzzle solver that uses two separate algorithms:
1. Backtracking
2. Cultural

It has a functional GUI that showcases how these two algorithms can solve kenken puzzles.

Setup Instructions:

1. Install Python

2. No external libraries are required

[Open the solver by running main.py]
